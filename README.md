Lemmings Paintball Level Editor

This is a working, but incomplete, level editor for the 1996 game Lemmings Paintball. I currently consider it to be in a late alpha stage of development.

The isometric map editor provides a WYSIWYG interface. The editor edits the Lemmings Paintball PBAIMOG.VSR resource file to include your level(s).

It's implemented in C#, using Visual Studio 2010 Express, .NET 2.0.
