Current Engine:

Each tile:
MapPanel asks Level for list of objects that should be drawn on a particular tile
Level asks each object whether it is overlapping the tile, and if so adds it to the list.
MapPanel tells object to draw itself. It gets its isoPosition, converts it to a screenPosition, then sends this data to the object to draw itself


New system:
Each tile:
MapPanel asks Level for list of objects that should be drawn on a particular tile
Level asks each object for a 'DrawnObject' object. If the object overlaps a particular tile, the LevelObject returns this DrawnObject object which contains a bitmap of the object and its draw offset in relation to the specified tile
